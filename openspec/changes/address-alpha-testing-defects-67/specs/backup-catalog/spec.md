## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Alembic and SQLAlchemy Core replace the PRAGMA user_version chain

The catalogue SHALL use Alembic and SQLAlchemy Core (without ORM) as its migration ledger. One first Alembic revision SHALL create the complete current catalogue schema, constraints, and indexes in a single step. A clean install SHALL apply only that first revision and SHALL NOT run the historical v2–v16 chain. Known existing alpha catalogues SHALL be backed up via SQLite `.backup`, verified, and stamped with the first revision only after schema equivalence is confirmed.

After the controlled transition, the old `PRAGMA user_version` ledger, `_run_migrations()`, `_migrate_v*`, intermediate schema fixtures, and code serving only obsolete catalogue forms SHALL be removed from production code. Stale tables, fields, entities, and compatibility branches SHALL be removed only after production code and known catalogues no longer use them. Subsequent schema changes SHALL be separate linear Alembic revisions.

Complex data migrations and data-preservation checks SHALL remain explicit. Alembic autogenerate SHALL NOT be considered proof of migration correctness. ORM models SHALL NOT be added and repository queries SHALL NOT be translated away from `sqlite3` by this change.

#### Scenario: Clean install skips the historical chain

- **WHEN** a fresh catalogue is created
- **THEN** only the first Alembic revision runs and no v2–v16 step executes

#### Scenario: Known catalogue is migrated and stamped

- **WHEN** a known alpha catalogue is migrated
- **THEN** a SQLite backup is created first, the schema is verified equivalent to the first revision, and the revision is stamped

#### Scenario: Old migrator is removed

- **WHEN** production code is inspected after the transition
- **THEN** `PRAGMA user_version` as a migration ledger, `_run_migrations()`, and `_migrate_v*` are absent

#### Scenario: CI rejects multiple heads

- **WHEN** CI runs the Alembic gate
- **THEN** multiple Alembic heads and unverified schema-metadata divergence are rejected

### Requirement: Project-owned remote download records project_id

All project-owned download flows SHALL record the canonical `project_id` in `start_download()` before HTTP transfer. This includes download-only refresh and remote-backup plus local-restore. Generic SDK backup without project context SHALL remain `project_id = NULL` and SHALL be visible only in the global list. Ownership SHALL NOT be inferred from environment/restore joins or from URL/database/branch matching.

For an already-created row with `project_id = NULL`, an explicit safe relink to a resolved current project or a documented repair path SHALL be available. Automatic ambiguous backfill SHALL NOT be performed.

#### Scenario: Project download records project_id

- **WHEN** a project-owned remote download completes
- **THEN** the resulting backup row has a non-null canonical `project_id`

#### Scenario: Generic backup stays unowned

- **WHEN** `client.instance(remote_url).databases.backup(...)` is called without project context
- **THEN** the resulting backup row has `project_id = NULL`

#### Scenario: Unowned row can be relinked safely

- **WHEN** an existing unowned backup is relinked to a resolved project
- **THEN** the UUID, file, and history remain unchanged and the row gains the canonical `project_id`
